# Instructions
The script, `update-dns-records`, matches the records in `active-records.json`
to the records within the zone sharing that name in Cloudflare and then pushes the server's IP
to those records.  

I am tired. I will make this more verbose later when I can.  

Run `./update-dns-records` with the flag `-s` or `--silent` to supress output.
