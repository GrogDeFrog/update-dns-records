# Instructions
There is a list of DNS records in `active-records.json`. The script,
`update-dns-records`, matches the details within that to records wtithin
Cloudflare and then pushes the server's IP.  

I am tired. I will make this more verbose later when I can.  

Run `./update-dns-records -s` or `--silent` to supress output.
